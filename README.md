Clay's Helper Functions

This is my repo for storing some basic functions I use to help automate tasks or make projects simpler. I'm just now beginning the process of converting my miscellaneous functions stored in random ugly script files into properly documented function files that can be built into a proper R package.


I'm starting with my simplest function (wrap_factor) and working on figure out how to get it to install and run properly. I'm going to add in some test data and hopefully build a vignette too. From there I'll add the other functions piece by piece.
